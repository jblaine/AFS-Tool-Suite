NON-BUG NOTES
=============

RO volumes on the same partition as their RW, as well as BK volumes,
are not counted when using quota_partinfo or volspot --method=quotapartinfo

BUGS
====

Need file locking for the cache!

An error should be thrown in quota_partinfo when the host or partition is
not found.  Also, the exit code should be nonzero.  It's very likely that
a lot of the scripts are quiet like this upon error.

With caching enabled, quota_partinfo and volspot --method=quotapartinfo
will silently fail to update the cache area if the querying user does
not have write permissions to the area.  This is actually not a bug in
itself, but it seems it could be reported somehow.
